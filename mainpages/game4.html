                Furious is a game where you join a team of explorers in the deep African jungle to find "The Widowmaker"
                as the local villagers calls it. People have witnessed something that looks like a lion/gorilla hybrid looking monster
                slaughtering not only other animals, but also humans getting too close to it. Hunters that have tried tracking it down,
                have all disappered, thereby the name.<br>
                <br>
                Your mission is to find The Widowmaker, and the main objective is to document that it actually exist.
                But beware - this creature is not your average .<br>
