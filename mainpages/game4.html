            <h3>Prove that the The Widowmaker actually exist!</h3><br>
            <p>
                Furious is a game where you join a team of explorers in the deep African jungle to find "The Widowmaker"
                as the local villagers calls it. People have witnessed the half-cat/half-gorilla looking monster slaughtering not only
                other animals, but also humans getting to close to it. Hunters that have tried tracking it down, have all disappered,
                thereby the name.<br>
                <br>
                Your mission is to find The Widowmaker. The main objective is to document that it actually exist.
                But beware, this creature is rumoured to being extremely hostile.<br>
