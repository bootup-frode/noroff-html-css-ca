<h2>About</h2>
<p align="center" style="text-align:center">
Game Hub Started up 6th of October 2022 after seeing how the pandemic in 2019 sky-rocketed the demand for games. People where stuck at home, and got more into gaming due to this.
<br><br>
Although platforms like Steam, GOG, Epic Games etc. exist, we still believe there is room for a online store that focuses on indie-games.
<br><br>
Indie-games can be just as fun, if not more, than games made by billion-dollar companies. We focus on publishing games that the player brings feedback to during the development phase.
<br><br>
We can proudly say that Game Hub offer games made by gamers.
